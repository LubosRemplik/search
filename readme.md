# Search Plugin for CakePHP #

This plugin extends https://github.com/CakeDC/search

It uses SearchIndexShell to save all pages from sitemap.xml into index so all results are in one table and then we can quite easily execute search with priority (meta title, meta description, meta keywords, content_for_layout are searched fields from top to low priority)
